# Music Library

music library is what i was making for my school homework but it turned out to be better than most in class so i decided to open source it for everyone to use it!.  

# Getting started
### File Structure
```
Root
 â”œâ”€â”€ songs(folder)
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ all your mp3 files go in here
 â”œâ”€â”€ coverpages(folder)
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ all the images png/jpg for song coverpages goes here
 â””â”€â”€ index.html
```
### Setup
after doing the file structure, all you have to do is 
go on line 186 and edit the songs files from there
```
 {
                id: 1,
                title: "name of song", 
                src: "songs/yoursong.mp3", 
                cover: "coverpages/yourcover.jpg"
 },
```
add as many songs as you need in that structure. id is optional though i do have plans to update this thats the reason its there.

running this is extremly simple, upload the songs in ```songs``` folder and then uploading coverpages in ```coverpages``` folder and lastly just add it in the index.html after line 186 onwards. 

if you do find bugs (extremely unlikely), have issues seting this up or if you would like to help the project feel free to reach me thru discord: `sirrocking`
